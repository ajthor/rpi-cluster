# Contribute

I created this project primarily for use as a testbed for distributed computing applications, robotics, and for use as a home micro-server. If you would like to contribute, the best way to help is by contributing to the [packages](#packages), or by creating your own!

# Future
Some things I would like to see happen in the future:

- Extensibility to other SBCs such as ODROID-C2.
- Connectivity with AWS and Google Cloud Services.
- Volume backup to B2 or some other service.
